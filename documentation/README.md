# Facile.js: A Simple Frontend Framework

## Introduction

Facile.js is a lightweight, from-scratch JavaScript framework for building single-page applications. It was created as an educational project to demonstrate and understand the core principles behind modern frontend frameworks. It includes a Virtual DOM, a centralized state management system, and a hash-based router.

This repository contains both the framework itself (in the `/framework` directory) and a sample TodoMVC application (in the `/todomvc` directory) built with it.
